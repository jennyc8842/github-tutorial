## Git vs. GitHub

**_Git_** is a system of version control mostly used by people who code and program. **_Github_** is a website that allows you to send your Git repositories on the internet. The difference between both of them is that **_Git_** is a tool to manage your code history while **_GitHub_** is a hosting service for Git repositories.

## Initial Setup
* To make a github account, [first go to this link](https://github.com/).
* Click sign up on the upper right corner.
* Fill in the contents you need.
* If you're a student of HSTAT, you enter in your hstat gmail **except for the @hstat.org** (ex: jennyc8842).
* If you're _NOT_ a student of HSTAT, you can make up the username.
* After that, you make a password that you are able to remember.
* Fill any further details and click 'Create Account'
* [IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) stands for Integrated Development Environment and it is where you'll be doing your work and is main code editor for majority of programmers.

17. Then, go back to the terminal and enter in **git add README.md** _(Adds the file, README.md to the staging area)_
18. After that, type in **git commit -m "(add message)"** _(Makes a commit that stores the changes, and a message along with it to know what you did)_
19. Paste the 2 codes you copied earlier.

## Workflow & Commands
When you save your file by doing _**CTRL + S**_, it is saving the changes you made into the file. Do this **every** time you made a change to the file!
  When you _**git add (filename)**_, it adds the file to the staging area. Use this when you made a change in the README file.
    When you _**git commit**_, you are adding the file and changes you made to your repository. Use this after when you _git add (filename)_!
      When you **_git push_**, you are transfering any changes from local repo up to the remote repo. Use this when you save, add and committed.
